Installing Rust

    run this command "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh"

    And install rustup using appropriate command based on OS

    I am running "sudo pacman -S rustup" in manjaro

    check version " rustc --version cargo --version "

Runnimg first code

    create a file with .rs extension and write the code in it

    compile the file using " rustc filename.rs "

    this will produce a new fle "filename" with out extension

    Now run the file "./filename"

Building a Cargo project

    create a cargo project using "cargo new project_name"

    to build cargo project "cargo build"

    to execute "./target/debug/projectname_as_file"

    to run "cargo run" this command buid and execute the project at the same time

To run a multiple file use the following command and also store the file inside src under folder named bin 

    cargo run --bin file_name

To add any libraries we need to use "cargo add library_name" to add it

To install any program use "cargo install lprogram_name" to install it
